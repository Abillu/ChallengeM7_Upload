# An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Analyzer
This is an analysis of ETF data stored in SQL database to establish the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF that consists of four stocks. The analysis is presented through professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations and a screenshot of the web application that I created by deploying my Jupyter notebook via the Voilà library. 

## Methodology and Approach

Used SQL queries with Python, Pandas, and hvPlot to analyze the performance of a single asset from the ETF

Used advanced SQL queries to optimize the efficiency of accessing data from the database.

Built the ETF portfolio by using SQL joins to combine all the data for each asset and then evaluated its performance.

## Libraries and Technologies Used

- Pandas library -  a Python library for data analysis. 

- SQLAlchemy -SQL library for Python

- hvPlot - visualization library. 

- Voilà library - to deploy the Juypter library as a web application

- Jupyter notebook
